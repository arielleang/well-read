Use the Well-Read Service to discover fantasy novels with a variety of subgenres that complement your reading style.
The service provides you with book recommendations based on the reader persona that most closely matches you.
Recommendations are based on pace, topics covered, and themes.

The API documentation covers the service's two resources: **books** and **personas** and their specific properties and operations.
The docs also provide tutorials that take you through how to use endpoints to do tasks within the service.
